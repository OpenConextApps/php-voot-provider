- better error handling in server side
  - create a configuration class that does something helpful when a config
    option is missing or malformed

- implement logging infrastructure, seems Slim has some functionality for that
  already so we can just use that

- REFACTORING
  - try to move all scope fiddling to the storage layer to have only 
    one format (strings) in the application (if at all possible...)
  - rename approval storing methods in de storage layer

- MANAGEMENT WEB INTERFACE
  - rename management client (manage/index.html) to admin (admin/index.html)
  - make a call to /manage redirect to /manage/index.html
  - We should probably strip out the management interface and demo client 
    completely and make them separate projects...
  - make it impossible to remove/edit the management client through the
    webinterface to make it impossible to lock yourself out.
  - implement a approval/token revoke dialog in the manage interface (next to 
    client administration, for normal users)
  - for confidential clients a secret is needed, for public clients not: hide
    it in the interface when switching the select box for client type to public
