- make it impossible to remove/edit the management client through the
  webinterface as to make it impossible to deny access to the management
  interface

- implement better error checking, also fix server to not give HTTP
  500s

- try to move all scope fiddling to the storage layer to have only one format
  (strings) in the application (if at all possible...)

- implement a revoke dialog in the manage interface (next to client 
  administration, for normal users)

- rename management client (manage/index.html) to admin (admin/index.html)

- make a call to /manage redirect to /manage/index.html

- rename approval storing methods in de storage layer

- implement logging infrastructure, seems Slim has some functionality for that
