- better error handling in server side

- implement logging infrastructure, seems Slim has some functionality for that
  already so we can just use that

- client_id cannot contain a ":" when it needs to use Basic authentication to
  the token endpoint

- validate redirect_uri on registration, it cannot contain '#'

- SECURITY
  - look into htaccess Authorization header rewrite to make it work better!

- REFACTORING

- MANAGEMENT WEB INTERFACE
  - rename management client (manage/index.html) to admin (admin/index.html)
  - make a call to /manage redirect to /manage/index.html
  - We should probably strip out the management interface and demo client 
    completely and make them separate projects...
  - make it impossible to remove/edit the management client through the
    webinterface to make it impossible to lock yourself out.
  - implement a approval/token revoke dialog in the manage interface (next to 
    client administration, for normal users)
  - for "web application" clients a secret is needed, for other clients not: 
    hide it in the interface when switching the select box for client profile to 
    something selse
