# PHP VOOT group provider

This project is a stand-alone VOOT group provider. The 
[VOOT specification](http://www.openvoot.org/) is implemented.

# Features
* PDO storage backend for VOOT data and OAuth tokens
* LDAP backend for VOOT
* Only OAuth 2 support
* SAML authentication support ([simpleSAMLphp](http://www.simplesamlphp.org)) 
* BrowserID support (almost)

# Requirements
The installation requirements on Fedora/CentOS can be installed like this:

    $ su -c 'yum install php-pdo php php-ldap httpd mod_xsendfile'

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install git sqlite3 php5 php5-sqlite unzip libapache2-mod-xsendfile php5-ldap

# Installation
The project includes an install script that downloads the required dependencies
and sets the permissions for the directories to write to and fixes SELinux 
permissions.

    $ cd /var/www/html
    $ git clone git://github.com/fkooman/phpvoot.git
    $ cd phpvoot
    $ docs/install.sh

On Ubuntu (Debian) you would typically install in `/var/www/phpvoot`.

# SELinux
The install script already takes care of setting the file permissions of the
`data/` directory to allow Apache to write to the directory. However, if you
want to use the LDAP backend to retrieve group information Apache also needs
the permission to access LDAP servers. If you want to use the BrowserID 
authentication plugin you also need to give Apache permission to access the 
network. These permissions can be given by using `setsebool` as root:

    $ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_ldap=on
    $ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=on

This is only for Red Hat based Linux distributions like RHEL, CentOS and 
Fedora.

# Apache
There is an example configuration file in `docs/apache.conf`. 

On Red Hat based distributions the file can be placed in 
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/phpvoot.conf`. On Debian based distributions the file can
be placed in `/etc/apache2/conf.d/phpvoot`. Be sure to modify it to suit your 
environment and do not forget to restart Apache. 

The install script from the previous section outputs a config for your system
which replaces the `/PATH/TO/APP` with the actual directory.

# Configuration
In the configuration file `config/voot.ini` and `config/oauth.ini` various 
aspects can be configured. To configure the SAML integration (in `oauth.ini`), 
make sure the following settings are correct:

    authenticationMechanism = "SspResourceOwner"

    ; simpleSAMLphp configuration
    [SspResourceOwner]
    sspPath = "/var/simplesamlphp/lib"
    authSource = "default-sp"

    resourceOwnerIdAttributeName = "uid"
    resourceOwnerDisplayNameAttributeName = "cn"
    ;resourceOwnerIdAttributeName = "urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:uid"
    ;resourceOwnerDisplayNameAttributeName = "urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:displayName"

## LDAP 
It is possible to use an LDAP server as backend to retrieve group membership.
It depends on your LDAP server configuration how to configure this. It is 
always helpful to start out with some `ldapsearch` commands to see what will 
work for your setup. Below is an example based on searching for `uid`:

    $ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -b "ou=People,dc=example,dc=org" "(uid=fkooman)" dn

This will retrieve the `distinguishedName` (DN) of that entry which can then in
turn be used to query for the users's groups:

    $ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -b "ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=org" "(uniqueMember=uid=fkooman,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org)" cn description

This works as well on Microsoft Active Directory servers (it does need a "bind" 
though in the default configuration):

    $ ldapsearch -H ldap://ad.example.org -b "cn=Users,dc=example,dc=org" -D "cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=org" -w s3cr3t "(samAccountName=fkooman)" dn

Now to fetch the groups for the user:

    $ ldapsearch -H ldap://ad.example.org -b "cn=Users,dc=example,dc=org" -D "cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=org" -w s3cr3t "(member=CN=Fran√ßois Kooman,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=org)" cn description

This can all be configured in `config/voot.ini`.

To test the configuration of your LDAP settings it is possible to use the 
`LdapTest.php` script in the `docs/` directory. First configure LDAP in 
`config/voot.ini` and then run the script like this:

    $ php docs/LdapTest.php fkooman

This should return an `array` with the group information. If it does not work,
make sure you match the configuration values with the `ldapsearch` commands 
that do work.

# Configuring OAuth Clients

The default OAuth token store contains two OAuth clients, one for the included
demo VOOT client (`client/index.html` and one for the management environment 
(`manage/index.html`). You may need to update the `redirect_uri` to have them
point to your actual server if you don't run the code on `localhost`:

    http://localhost/phpvoot/manage/index.html

Modify it to the actual location where the files were installed, for example:

    https://www.example.org/phpvoot/manage/index.html

To update the client registration:

    $ echo "UPDATE Client SET redirect_uri='https://www.example.org/phpvoot/client/index.html' WHERE id='voot';" | sqlite3 data/oauth2.sqlite
    $ echo "UPDATE Client SET redirect_uri='https://www.example.org/phpvoot/manage/index.html' WHERE id='manage';" | sqlite3 data/oauth2.sqlite

You also need to modify the API endpoint in `manage/manage.js`:

    var apiRoot = 'http://localhost/phpvoot';

To (in this example):

    var apiRoot = 'https://www.example.org/phpvoot';

Once this is done you can manage the OAuth client registrations by going to the
URL configured above at `https://www.example.org/phpvoot/manage/index.html`. Make
sure the user identifiers you want to allow `admin` permissions are listed in 
the `adminResourceOwnerId[]` list in `config/oauth.ini`.

# Testing

A JavaScript client is included to test the VOOT provider. It uses the 
"implicit grant" OAuth 2 profile to obtain an access token. The client can 
be found at `client/index.html`. Modify the client registration and the file 
`client/voot.js` to point to the correct base endpoint as well.
